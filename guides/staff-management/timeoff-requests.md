## Time off Icons
To also help you identify which staff are currently out without checking the Time off Page or their Directory Profile, you can see them in Views.

| Icon | Description |
| -- | -- |
| ![green-icon](/img/) | **Green Icon** shows that the user is currently out. |
| ![yellow-icon](/img/) | **Yellow Icon** shows that the user is currently in time off this week. |
| ![black-icon](/img/) | **Black Icon** shows that the user is in time off last week. This is helpful if let's say you have a one-week cooldown for LOA or Time off Requests. |
