## Time off Icons
To also help you identify which staff are currently out without checking the Time off Page or their Directory Profile, you can see it right beside their username in Views.

| Icon | Description |
| -- | -- |
| ![green-icon](/img/loa-green.png) | **Green Icon** shows that the user is currently out. |
| ![yellow-icon](/img/loa-yellow.png) | **Yellow Icon** shows that the user is currently in time off this week. |
| ![grey-icon](/img/loa-black.png) | **Grey Icon** shows that the user is in time off last week. This is helpful if let's say you have a one-week cooldown for LOA or Time off Requests. |
