## How to add a Manager?
**Manager** is a field in Directory Profile that shows who is the manager of the staff. For example, let's say your group has a rule that every 5 Middle Ranks is controlled by 1 supervisor/manager. This can show their entire chain of command.

To do this, go to the Staff Details and in Directory Profile, find Manager. Click "Edit" and enter in the Manager's username. Once done, hit "Save".
