# General

The first tab of the settings displays three different details. 
- Workspace name can be whatever you would like. Although we recommend naming it the name of your group.
- Roblox Group ID cannot be changed. This is automatically done after you created your workspace. Remember when you selected a group to create your workspace?
- Lastly, the next option determines when your "rotations" are. Your activity can either be automatically reset at 12:00 AM on Sunday morning. So if you decide for your week to start on Sunday, activity will be due Saturday night and Sunday will be the next rotation. If you choose Monday, activity will be due Sunday night and the next rotation will begin on Monday.

12:00 AM is midnight, not noon.
