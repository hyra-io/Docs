# Home Layout

The home layout setting allows for you to choose a specific game to show up on your Hyra's homepage. These should be your group games, but these games do not have to be owned by your group.

The game ID can be found in the link once you are on its join page.

Afterwards all of your workspace members can easily navigate between games while checking their activity.
