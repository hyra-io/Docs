# How to claim a session?
For Middle Ranks to High Ranks that want to book a session, this is the article that you need! In this article, we'll be talking about on how to create a session and how to join.

## Creating a Server
Before a session can be started, most must create a server. To do this, they must have the "Sessions - Create New Server" permission.

To create a server, go to Activity > Sessions > [Selected Session]

In the session, click "**+ Create Server**", once done, it should show up like this:

If you want to create another server, just click the "**+ Create Server**" again to create one!

## Joining as a Host/Co-Host
If you are the Host or Co-Host of the session, simply click the spot and click: "**Take It**" to take the role of the Host or Co-Host. 

Please note that you need permission: "Sessions - Assign Host to Self" (for Hosts), or "Sessions - Assign Co-Host to Self" (for Co-Hosts) for you to voluntary take the session.

::: info
For users that have the permission:
1. "Sessions - Assign Host to other People" (for Host)
2. "Sessions - Assign Co-host to Other People" (for Co-Host)
3. "Sessions - Assign Roles to other People" (for Roles)

You can type in the target user's username and add them to the role.

## Leaving the Role
Let's say there's an urgent thing that you need to do but the session is near, you can leave the role by clicking the X on the right side of your username. Same rule also applies for the Host and Co-Host positions.
