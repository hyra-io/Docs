## Joining as a Host/Co-Host
If you are the Host or Co-Host of the session, simply click the spot and click: "**Take It**" to take the role of the Host or Co-Host. 

Please note that you need the permission: "Sessions - Assign Host to Self" (for Hosts), or "Sessions - Assign Co-Host to Self" (for Co-Hosts) for them to voluntary take the session.
