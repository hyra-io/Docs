# Role Groups
**Role Groups** are the foundation of attendance at sessions. They are available to be given to one staff member and are arranged into groups. For example, you might have a role group named 'Cashier A' with 1 trainer and 3 assistants beneath it.  In this article, we'll show you how to create a Role Group.

To create a Role Group, you need to go to Settings > Sessions > Roles. In the tab, click **Create a Group.**

Once clicked, it will ask you to create a Group Name.

Once finished, you can now set how many roles does that group have? For example, let's say you need at least 2 spectators and rankers in your Training Session, type Spectator 1 and hit +.
> Please note that only **one person** can join the role. That means if you have added 4 Trainers, there will only be 4 trainers in the session.

## Deleting a Role Group
Deleting a Role Group is pretty simple, just hit **Delete** in the role group and confirm. If you accidentally created another role in a Role Group, you can simply click the trash icon beside the role.
