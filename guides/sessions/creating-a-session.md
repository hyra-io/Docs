# Creating a Session
**Sessions** are one-time or repeating events that occur in your group. For example, you could create a session for all of your training sessions, shifts, etc. 

To create a session, head over to Settings > Sessions, and click "**+ Add Session**"

Once clicked, it will ask you for the details of the session. From what time, what Role groups? and many more. Once finished, hit "**Save**"
