# Docs
Welcome to Hyra's Public Documentation! This documentation is responsible for both our support articles and guides as well as our technical documentation for Developers. 

Our documentation is powered by Docusaurus, which is a React based documentation system built by Meta. Our documentation is fully open-source and can be edited and updated by anyone. 

The search on our documentation is powered by Algolia. We reindex our search on every "main" branch update. This is a manual process that only maintainers can carry out. 

## Spotted a typo? 
Please fork our repo and make a pull request with the fix. We will merge in all valid pull requests. We appreciate your contribution! :smiley: 

## Local Development
To run the documentation locally, please run

The documentation will be served on your localhost accessible at port 3000.
