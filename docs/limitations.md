# Technical Limitations

Due to technical limits of the underlying systems we use, there are some limitations to what we can support.

## Limitations

- It is not possible to track the activity of more than **5,000 users** actively. This is due to limitations of the Roblox groups API and our need to sync the data. There is no limit for the numbers of inactive users that can be stored.
- It is not possible to automatically assign Hyra roles to Roblox group ranks that exceed 2,000 total users.
