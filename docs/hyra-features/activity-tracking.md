# Activity Tracking
Activity Tracking are essential on many workspaces to make sure that their staff is working enough to make sure every guest is managed enough and have the best time in their experiences. Here, we'll be featuring different features that can help you manage your staff activity using Hyra's Activity Tracking and Assignments!

## Activity
In the Activity Tab, your staff will be able to see their own activity. Hyra also features a activity history that shows how active you are in the past year! Other than that, you can also see a leaderboard to show the most active staff to beat!

## Assignments
Assignments can help you deploy tasks that your staff are needed to do. For now, it is only limited to sessions or minutes, but in the future, we may expand it to more requirements.
