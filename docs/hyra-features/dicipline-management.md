# Dicipline Management
Dicipline Management is important in any workspace. We know we have staff where they refuse to do work and disrespect the higher-ups and this is where warnings can be helpful! Here, we will be featuring different features that can help you manage warnings, promotions/demotions, suspensions, terminations, etc. using Hyra's Logbook and Staff Views!

## Staff Views
Staff views are how workspace admins can view information about their employees all at once. Hyra's design is made to help you efficiently manage your group. In this feature, you can create customized views depending on what details are most important.

You can also sort people based on their warnings recieved!
